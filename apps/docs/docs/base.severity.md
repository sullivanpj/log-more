## Severity type

The potential values of the `severity` field. Higher values indicate a more damaging event. If the severity is `NONE` (or 0), the condition will never be be met. If the severity is `CRITICAL` (or 99), the condition will always be be met.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Severity = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 99;
```
