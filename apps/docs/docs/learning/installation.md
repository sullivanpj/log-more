# Installation

The purpose of this document is to outline the installation process for the `log-right` package.

## Installing the Log-Right Package

Open a command prompt inside of your current project's directory and run the below command:

```bash
$ npm i log-right --save
# or
$ yarn add -D log-right
```

If the above command was executed successfully, the package should be installed correctly. **Congrats!** You are now ready to [get started](getting-started.md) using log-right.
