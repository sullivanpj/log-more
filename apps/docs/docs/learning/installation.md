# Installation

The purpose of this document is to outline the installation process for the `log-more` package.

## Installing the Log-More Package

Open a command prompt inside of your current project's directory and run the below command:

```bash
$ npm i log-more --save
# or
$ yarn add -D log-more
```

If the above command was executed successfully, the package should be installed correctly. **Congrats!** You are now ready to [get started](getting-started.md) using log-more.
